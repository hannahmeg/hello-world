          <p><strong>How the income of those in the Taxi Industry is affected</strong></p><br><br>
          <p>Because of this disruption which involved the shift of passengers and drivers to Ride-sharing companies, there is a significant decrease in the economy of the Taxi Industry, both operators and drivers alike.</p><br><br>
          <p>The figure below shows the comparative earnings of Uber Drivers and Taxi Drivers in the U.S. on an hourly basis.</p><br><br>
          <p>In the Philippine setting, a study was conducted by Beltran et.al (2019), wherein the researchers recruited informants from the Philippines 
             from varied major areas of Metro Manila. The informants were nine drivers of a conventional taxi who have been driving such for at least 5 years 
             and some taxi operators and LTFRB personnel as well. After data collection, one of the six emergent themes that were developed from the data was the
             financial effects of the presence of Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) on the taxi drivers and operators wherein the informants expressed 
             concerns on the economic consequence of TNVS sharing their market. According to one of the informants, “It (income) has significantly decreased. Before,
             the income in taxi driving was good. But, with their (TNVS) presence, you are fortunate to earn Php1000 for a 24 hours of taxi driving”. The researchers 
             also cited a similar study conducted by Chang (2017) about The Economic Effects of Uber on Taxi Drivers in Taiwan. Journal of Competition Law and Economics 
             wherein results showed that the regular revenue of taxi drivers is reduced by an estimated 12% in the first year of Uber operation and 18% in its third year.</p><br><br>
          <p>A survey was conducted by Yugatech wherein they interviewed the taxi drivers who participated in the survey. Driver “Ernesto” shared his sentiments regarding 
             his declining profits as Uber and Grab become the more preferred service by the riding public. “Yung kinakaltas sa’min na boundary e tumataas na, pero nalulugi 
             kami sa hina ng pasada namin sa kalsada. Tingin ko kikita ako ng malaki kung magddrive ako for Uber.”</p><br><br>
          <p><strong>But why do ride-sharing drivers earn more than taxi drivers?</strong></p><br><br>
          <p>Besides the fact that there is an increase in the passengers that prefer to opt for ride-sharing services resulting in a larger market, a significant factor 
             that increases the profit of ride-sharing drivers is the software that allows them to better optimize their time and services. According to Oxford Martin School’s 
             Carl Benedikt Frey who studied the impact that Uber has had on the income of taxi drivers in a range of U.S. cities. “The higher hourly earnings among self-employed
             drivers suggest that capacity utilization, in terms of the time spent in the car with a passenger, has increased with Uber, as its platform allows for better 
             matching between drivers and passengers. But for traditional taxi drivers, the effect has been the opposite, with a decline in the amount of time they have a 
            passenger in their vehicle”.</p><br><br>
