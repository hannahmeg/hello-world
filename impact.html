          <h1>Who are affected in the Disruption</h1><br>
        
          <h2>Traditional taxi- Cab Operators and drivers</h2>
        
          <p>Essentially ride sharing is wiping out the taxi cab industry and particularly the operators and the drivers of the traditional taxi company.
             It forces them to either update and compete with the new trend. Unlike the regular taxis, ride sharing innovation is opening up a new market with its various forays, which the traditional cab company cannot cope up with.
             At a certain level that regular taxis cannot offer service like, dabbling in chopper rides, food delivery and more. This innovation allows the ride sharing company to grow and break the stranglehold taxis had on consumers.
             According to (limpin 2018), drivers chose to be in the ride sharing industry instead of a traditional one because of the financial benefits they enjoy from the service.</p>
        
          <p>Another factor is that Uber tailors to supply and demand using surge pricing as an incentive to increase the amount of drivers during peak hours.
             Also in ride sharing, non-professional drivers of private vehicles can now provide safe, reliable, and affordable point-to-point rides and enable the riding public to efficiently get a ride with a tap on a smartphone.</p>
      
          <p>In addition, the emergence of the ridesharing phenomenon has also created new labour opportunities and conditions of the driving work itself. Moreover, ridesharing promises to improve the livelihood of the drivers.
             Ride sharing companies specifically look to provide a safe transportation platform including screening all drivers and vehicles, education and code of conduct, including safety features, support services, and insurance.
             With these advantages surely the drivers will earn more and be protected from their trips as well.</p>
    
    
          <h2>It affected the consumer in a positive and negative way</h2>
  
          <p>A positive impact is that ride-sharing made rides better in many ways due to the feedback mechanism in their app which continuously improved as new parameters have been and are added due to consumers' concern.
             In ride sharing if there are any issues, it can be directly resolved from the app and get a refund which is near impossible to do or extremely complicated when it comes to regular taxis.
             It also helped not only our consumers but also the society and the environment since it eliminates traffic congestion, conserving fuel and reducing air pollution as well, also it helped save the travel cost and time. (Furuhata et al. 2013).</p><br>
  
          <p>Yet on a negative thought, we have to bear in mind that our elders are not fully immersed with the latest technology therefore there is a small glitch when it comes to usage of applications for them.
             However, the app has a 911 emergency call which is essential when you have elderly clients.</p><br>
  
  
          <h1>Statistical data of</h1><br>
  
           <h2>Passengers who choose ride sharing over taxi</h2>
  
           <p>The Philippines is one of the wide adopters of ridesharing services with an estimated 2.96 million users in 2018 and is expected to hit 5.4 million by 2022 (Statista 2018a).
              Consequently, the Philippines became the first country to develop nationwide ride-hailing regulations, which allowed app-based transportation services to operate legally anywhere in the nation (Toppa 2015).
              The increasing demand for mobility and the lack of adequate mass transport, especially in Metro Manila, was what apparently impelled the legalization of ridesharing services (Morales 2015).
              Ride sharing companies like Grab stated that their app has been downloaded to 139 million devices, also that they receive more than 6 million ride orders daily.
              Customers are persuaded to go for ride sharing like Grab since they worked on customer retention by creating a reward program that allows clients to earn points that can be redeemed in various ways, like airline discounts, free fast-food, and free rides.
              They also extend their financial services, by releasing its QR-code based mobile payment app, GrabPay in 2016.</p>
             
           <p>A Statista report (2018b) shows that a worldwide user penetration rate of ridesharing services is at 9.8% in 2018 and is expected to hit 13.3% in 2022.</p>
  
          <p>In the United State, Uber currently has 75 million riders globally.In a survey in the US 25% of customers used ride sharing service once per month while Lyft another ride sharing company  has 32 million users in the US within the same period of study.</p>
  
  
          <h2>Drivers who choose transport companies instead of taxi companies</h2>

          <p>In ride sharing innovation Uber was one of the first companies that conquered the platform.It has been able to develop systems which exploit the full potential of the assets (cars), resulting in lower cost and high turnover, thereby resulting in benefits to the customers as well as the driver.
            The new ecosystem of ride sharing services created by Uber has been able to create a dent into the otherwise “hard to crack” taxi industry. Uber has universally transformed the taxi industry. The company has managed to restore the confidence of consumers in ride sharing services.
            Uber changed the dynamics all together by making it possible to order cabs digitally. The proliferation of ridesharing services could be attributed to the economic benefits, in particular monetary gains, afforded to the drivers (Hamari et al. 2016; Hawlitschek et al. 2016; Malone and Dillahunt 2015; Tussyadiah 2015).
            For instance, about one-third of the Uber drivers in the United States engaged in the service to earn money while looking for more side incomes.</p>

          <p>Uber has 3 million drivers globally. 800,000 drivers in the United states alone and it is operating in almost 60 countries and counting. As of third quarter in 2019 there were 3 million Lyft drivers. Grab company has had 2.8 million people worldwide that drive for them.</p><br>

          <p>In the Philippines last June 2019 we have an estimate of  45,000 TNVS drivers currently registered under grab Philippines.</p><br>


          <h1>How the income of those in the Taxi Industry is affected</h1>

          <p>Because of this disruption which involved the shift of passengers and drivers to Ride-sharing companies, there is a significant decrease in the economy of the Taxi Industry, both operators and drivers alike.</p>

          <p>The figure below shows the comparative earnings of Uber Drivers and Taxi Drivers in the U.S. on an hourly basis.</p><br>

          <p>In the Philippine setting, a study was conducted by Beltran et.al (2019), wherein the researchers recruited informants from the Philippines 
             from varied major areas of Metro Manila. The informants were nine drivers of a conventional taxi who have been driving such for at least 5 years 
             and some taxi operators and LTFRB personnel as well. After data collection, one of the six emergent themes that were developed from the data was the
             financial effects of the presence of Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) on the taxi drivers and operators wherein the informants expressed 
             concerns on the economic consequence of TNVS sharing their market. According to one of the informants, “It (income) has significantly decreased. Before,
             the income in taxi driving was good. But, with their (TNVS) presence, you are fortunate to earn Php1000 for a 24 hours of taxi driving”. The researchers 
             also cited a similar study conducted by Chang (2017) about The Economic Effects of Uber on Taxi Drivers in Taiwan. Journal of Competition Law and Economics 
             wherein results showed that the regular revenue of taxi drivers is reduced by an estimated 12% in the first year of Uber operation and 18% in its third year.</p>

          <p>A survey was conducted by Yugatech wherein they interviewed the taxi drivers who participated in the survey. Driver “Ernesto” shared his sentiments regarding 
             his declining profits as Uber and Grab become the more preferred service by the riding public. “Yung kinakaltas sa’min na boundary e tumataas na, pero nalulugi 
             kami sa hina ng pasada namin sa kalsada. Tingin ko kikita ako ng malaki kung magddrive ako for Uber.”</p><br>

          <h2>But why do ride-sharing drivers earn more than taxi drivers?</h2>

          <p>Besides the fact that there is an increase in the passengers that prefer to opt for ride-sharing services resulting in a larger market, a significant factor 
             that increases the profit of ride-sharing drivers is the software that allows them to better optimize their time and services. According to Oxford Martin School’s 
             Carl Benedikt Frey who studied the impact that Uber has had on the income of taxi drivers in a range of U.S. cities. “The higher hourly earnings among self-employed
             drivers suggest that capacity utilization, in terms of the time spent in the car with a passenger, has increased with Uber, as its platform allows for better 
             matching between drivers and passengers. But for traditional taxi drivers, the effect has been the opposite, with a decline in the amount of time they have a 
            passenger in their vehicle”.</p><br>
