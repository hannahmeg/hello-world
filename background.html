          <h1>Business Model of Ride Sharing VS Taxi</h1>
          <p> Taxis has been operating since 1980. Taxi services are everywhere in the city that is operated by a company or an independent owner. Regarding rideshare services, the vehicle driver is commonly the owner as he/she drives his vehicle to earn money by driving passengers to a certain place.  
</p>
          <p>Rideshare vehicles customarily have a company sticker or logo as an identifier. For example, we can spot the Uber logo on all the cars operating this service. On the other hand, a taxi will typically possess a ‘taxi’ sticker or sometimes a sticker of the company that owns it. 
 </p>

          <p>Almost all ridesharing companies require their drivers to take pieces of training before they can start working with them in order to teach the various security precautions, rules, etiquettes, etc. For taxi services and drivers, ought to be licensed by the government authority like LTO (Land Transportation Office) in order for them to operate in a specific city or town.
 </p>
          <p>Taxi and ridesharing services have middlemen. The app owner companies like Uber and other ridesharing services are the middlemen who charge a fee from the drivers’ profits in trade for their services. The taxi owner or company owner can be the middleman where they may charge a percentage from the drivers for letting them utilize the taxi unit/s.
 </p>
          <p>Talking about the schedule, taxi drivers usually work fixed turns and do not hold so enough flexibility. On the other hand, Ride-share drivers, possess the flexibility to work, they are free to work anytime they want.
 </p>   
          <p>They have different ways how to get their service. Rideshare services operate by means of mobile applications, in which a rider can book a vehicle. The driver is notified that someone is needing their service through the app and he will arrive and pick up the passengers at the requested location. With this application, passengers can also trace the driver’s location while waiting.

 </p>
          <p>In contrast, taxi services usually operate through phone calls and straight hailing, where usually a passenger has to wait on the road and make a sign to stop a taxi or call a taxi company asking to send a taxi to pick them up at the requested address.

 </p>
          <p>Pricing is a big part of taking a taxi or rideshare services. Taxis charge per kilometer when moving and charge per minute while it is not in motion. In a different manner, rideshare services charge per kilometer and per minute, despite whether they are in motion or not and with some exclusions.
