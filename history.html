          <h1>Definition of disruptive tech in ride sharing context</h1>
          
          <p>According to Investopedia, “[disruptive] technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate… [and that it] sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior” (Smith, 2020).</p>
         
          <p>In that definition alone, it is not surprising that ride sharing apps have become disruptive to the taxi industry in that it is catered to solve the customers’ main pet peeves when in ridehailing. The primary aspect of this disruptive tech that entices a lot of people to use it is the convenient, immediate, and communication-efficient solution that a single app on their phone can give to their major needs as commuters. Not only that but this industry has opened doors of opportunities for a lot of people to earn extra-income without having to go through the rigorous process of applying for a taxi company.</p>
          
          <h1>History of ride sharing apps</h1>
          <p>If we look at the nature of Ride Sharing Apps, it can be said that hailing rides has indeed been digitized and that it has become the norm for people to commute aside from using the subways and buses. <p>
         
          <p>Ridehailing’s history goes way back to 1605 when the first form of transportation – by way of horse and carriage – was implemented, which then transformed into the car-based services during 1908. By 2010, Uber tried to provide a solution to some wealthy people for hailing limousines and at that point, ride sharing apps have started to lift off with Lyft launching a way for hitchhikers to hail rides easily during 2012. That year became the momentous times that people finally started to welcome ride sharing apps as a norm. </p>
          
          <p>In the closest sense of what it has become today, the general concept of ride sharing apps was launched in 2009 by Garrett Camp when Uber first came onto the scene as ‘UberCab.’ After their beta launch in May of 2010, Uber’s services along with their mobile app were officially launched the following year in San Francisco, USA. In the early days, however, Uber was built around the premise of black car service and private drivers, with only black luxury cars and prices 1.5 times that of a standard cab. After complaints were made by San Francisco-based taxi operators, ‘UberCab’ became what it is today and was renamed to simply ‘Uber.‘</p>
          
          <h1>How did it gain popularity</h1>
          <p>Ride sharing Apps started primarily because of the ride hailing trend. It emerged from the innovation of shared mobility that catered to the consumer’s need for quick, convenient, and cost-effective transportation.</p>
       
          <p>By imitating the long-known taxi form of commuting, ridehailing connects the rider and the driver by a smartphone app, allowing riders to easily hail a ride, track where the driver is— real-time, and be given pricing before confirming the ride. On the business-side, ride hailing applications have opened up the driving industry to a wider range of people seeking employment, creating an opportunity for side hustles to many people who own vehicles.</p>
          
          <p>After estimating the demand that was similar to a cab, ridehailing started to evolve into what it is today: spring of 2012, Uber launched a service in Chicago, USA allowing riders to request a regular taxi or an Uber driver with its mobile app. When summer of 2012 arrived, UberX was implemented, allowing people to drive for Uber using their own personal vehicles (of course, subject to meeting certain vehicle standards). After beta testing in the SanFrancisco bay area, Uber launched UberPOOL (an option to carpool using the same app) in the summer of 2014. During the same year Uber has been looking for ways to implement ridehailing in other ways, something that can cater in parcel delivery and food delivery industries. Later that year, Uber launched UberFresh (now UberEats) to deliver food to consumers in Beverly Hills, California.</p>
          
          <p>In 2012, Uber’s largest competitor ‘Lyft’ came onto the scene. Lyft was offered as a service under Zimride, a long-distance ridesharing company operating since 2007, they are focused on providing shared rides for longer trips and linking drivers and passengers through Facebook. By the spring of 2014, Lyft was operating in a total of 60 US cities and competing heavily against Uber. By summer of 2014, Lyft Line was invented creating passengers to split fare on shared rides (and making it more affordable). The difference you may ask, Zimride and Lyft represents the difference between ridesharing and ridehailing today – Zimride is more similar to carpooling with strangers, while Lyft is more similar to calling your own private taxi.</p>
          
          <p>The second largest ridehailing company in the world, ‘DiDi’ was founded in June of 2012, initially it was named as ‘Didi Dache’, an app to request taxis for immediate pick up and soon enough allowing people to reserve taxis for the next day. Today DiDi is one of the major taxi apps in China, with over 100 million users in more than 300 cities. Also in 2012, GrabTaxi was launched in Malaysia as a mobile taxi booking app and expanded to the Philippines in the summer of 2013.</p>
          
          <p>In 2016, the company changed their brand name into ‘Grab,’ offering more of their products under the brand including:
          <strong>
          <br>GrabCar, personal car service;
          <br>GrabFood, food delivery;
          <br>GrabShare, carpooling;
          <br>GrabExpress, delivery service.</strong></p>
