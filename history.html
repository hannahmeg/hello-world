          <p><strong>History!/strong> If we look at the nature of Ride Sharing Apps, it can be said that hailing rides has indeed been digitized and that it has become the norm for people to commute aside from using the subways and buses. <p>
          <br>
          <p>Ridehailing’s history goes way back to 1605 when the first form of transportation – by way of horse and carriage – was implemented, which then transformed into the car-based services during 1908. By 2010, Uber tried to provide a solution to some wealthy people for hailing limousines and at that point, ride sharing apps have started to lift off with Lyft launching a way for hitchhikers to hail rides easily during 2012. That year became the momentous times that people finally started to welcome ride sharing apps as a norm. </p>
          <br>
          <p>In the closest sense of what it has become today, the general concept of ride sharing apps was launched in 2009 by Garrett Camp when Uber first came onto the scene as ‘UberCab.’ After their beta launch in May of 2010, Uber’s services along with their mobile app were officially launched the following year in San Francisco, USA. In the early days, however, Uber was built around the premise of black car service and private drivers, with only black luxury cars and prices 1.5 times that of a standard cab. After complaints were made by San Francisco-based taxi operators, ‘UberCab’ became what it is today and was renamed to simply ‘Uber.‘</p>
