          <p><strong> Will the continuous disruption of ride sharing applications put an end to the taxi industry? </strong>
            Possibly. If so, former taxi drivers might switch to working for ridesharing companies. Although ridesharing applications disrupt the market, it also provides job opportunities to many. The contractors and independent taxi owners, however, will be at loss in this scenario. </p> 
          <p>Nonetheless, the speeding momentum of ridesharing companies' market share growth, somehow developing a monopoly, is a call for governments and other legal subjects to appropriately regulate and ensure that its price policy is fair and not founded on tax schemes or predatory pricing. </p> 
          <p>In the further future, will the convenience of such use of new technologies opt the people to avail these kinds of transportation services over actually owning their own automobiles? If so, then ridesharing applications will not only disrupt the taxi industry but also automobile companies' market. However, it is highly likely that future transportation services that utilizes new technologies will be run by big tech companies and automakers. In his article "Why Uber and Lyft Will Have a Short Lifespan..", Peppers (2020) discusses how ridesharing services themselves will be subject to the same forces of innovation that has been overturning the taxi industry. This is a good point since automakers and tech giants are now looking for a quick way to monetize self-driving technology. </p> 
          <p>Driverless cars represent both a threat and an opportunity for car makers. The threat, obviously, is that far fewer people will need to own their own cars. But the opportunity is that the auto companies themselves have the capital necessary to deploy fleets of self-driving cars for hiring out on an hourly basis. 
            -Pepper, 2020 </p> 
          <p>The future of ride sharing applications and its disruptive features is fast approaching. New technologies, in general, continue to change our everyday lives. Although we cannot completely prepare for these changes, asking ourselves where we're heading is always a good way to sort out our attitudes, plans, and policies. </p>
