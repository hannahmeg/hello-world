1st Webpage: The History of Ride-Sharing

Definition of disruptive tech in ride sharing context

	According to Investopedia, “[disruptive] technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate… [and that it] sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior” (Smith, 2020).

	In that definition alone, it is not surprising that ride sharing apps have become disruptive to the taxi industry in that it is catered to solve the customers’ main pet peeves when in ridehailing. The primary aspect of this disruptive tech that entices a lot of people to use it is the convenient, immediate, and communication-efficient solution that a single app on their phone can give to their major needs as commuters. Not only that but this industry has opened doors of opportunities for a lot of people to earn extra-income without having to go through the rigorous process of applying for a taxi company.

History of ride sharing apps

If we look at the nature of Ride Sharing Apps, it can be said that hailing rides has indeed been digitized and that it has become the norm for people to commute aside from using the subways and buses.

Ridehailing’s history goes way back to 1605 when the first form of transportation – by way of horse and carriage – was implemented, which then transformed into the car-based services during 1908. By 2010, Uber tried to provide a solution to some wealthy people for hailing limousines and at that point, ride sharing apps have started to lift off with Lyft launching a way for hitchhikers to hail rides easily during 2012. That year became the momentous times that people finally started to welcome ride sharing apps as a norm.

In the closest sense of what it has become today, the general concept of ride sharing apps was launched in 2009 by Garrett Camp when Uber first came onto the scene as ‘UberCab.’ After their beta launch in May of 2010, Uber’s services along with their mobile app were officially launched the following year in San Francisco, USA. In the early days, however, Uber was built around the premise of black car service and private drivers, with only black luxury cars and prices 1.5 times that of a standard cab. After complaints were made by San Francisco-based taxi operators, ‘UberCab’ became what it is today and was renamed to simply ‘Uber.‘
How did it gain popularity

	Ride sharing Apps started primarily because of the ride hailing trend. It emerged from the innovation of shared mobility that catered to the consumer’s need for quick, convenient, and cost-effective transportation. 

By imitating the long-known taxi form of commuting, ridehailing connects the rider and the driver by a smartphone app, allowing riders to easily hail a ride, track where the driver is— real-time, and be given pricing before confirming the ride. On the business-side, ride hailing applications have opened up the driving industry to a wider range of people seeking employment, creating an opportunity for side hustles to many people who own vehicles.

After estimating the demand that was similar to a cab, ridehailing started to evolve into what it is today: spring of 2012, Uber launched a service in Chicago, USA allowing riders to request a regular taxi or an Uber driver with its mobile app. When summer of 2012 arrived, UberX was implemented, allowing people to drive for Uber using their own personal vehicles (of course, subject to meeting certain vehicle standards). After beta testing in the SanFrancisco bay area, Uber launched UberPOOL (an option to carpool using the same app) in the summer of 2014. During the same year Uber has been looking for ways to implement ridehailing in other ways, something that can cater in parcel delivery and food delivery industries. Later that year, Uber launched UberFresh (now UberEats) to deliver food to consumers in Beverly Hills, California.

In 2012, Uber’s largest competitor ‘Lyft’ came onto the scene. Lyft was offered as a service under Zimride, a long-distance ridesharing company operating since 2007, they are focused on providing shared rides for longer trips and linking drivers and passengers through Facebook. By the spring of 2014, Lyft was operating in a total of 60 US cities and competing heavily against Uber. By summer of 2014, Lyft Line was invented creating passengers to split fare on shared rides (and making it more affordable). The difference you may ask, Zimride and Lyft represents the difference between ridesharing and ridehailing today – Zimride is more similar to carpooling with strangers, while Lyft is more similar to calling your own private taxi.

The second largest ridehailing company in the world, ‘DiDi’ was founded in June of 2012, initially it was named as ‘Didi Dache’, an app to request taxis for immediate pick up and soon enough allowing people to reserve taxis for the next day. Today DiDi is one of the major taxi apps in China, with over 100 million users in more than 300 cities. Also in 2012, GrabTaxi was launched in Malaysia as a mobile taxi booking app and expanded to the Philippines in the summer of 2013.

In 2016, the company changed their brand name into ‘Grab,’ offering more of their products under the brand including:

GrabCar, personal car service;
GrabFood, food delivery;
GrabShare, carpooling;
GrabExpress, delivery service.

	

The Dilemma for Ride Sharing Apps


	The question perhaps then shifts to whether taxis were threatened from the outset or did this reaction develop over time. Because the slope of ride sharing apps improvement has been so rapid and it has scaled so quickly into the mainstream of taxis’ businesses, this may be a hard question to answer definitively. One reason why ride sharing apps are smart to avoid buying medallions at the outset was that they would have placed it in head-on competition with taxi companies—and ride sharing apps would have lost that regulatory battle. Going around the regulations by avoiding being a taxi company and owning medallions was savvy and heeded the lessons from disruptive innovation.

Similarly, although ride sharing apps made its intentions of displacing the taxi market known early on, taxi companies arguably didn’t perceive it as directly competitive with their core market at the outset. The fact that ride sharing apps are significantly lower cost than taxis and powered by a technology enabler that allows it to move up-market and improve extremely rapidly inside of a business model innovation that makes it almost impossible for taxis to respond effectively feels like a classic disruptive innovation relative to taxis once accounting for the counterintuitive up-market move it made.

Although the theory of disruptive innovation was discovered to solve a mystery the theory does not imply that a company has to be well run to be disrupted. In short, a better understanding of ride sharing app’s origins, business model, and asymmetric advantages over taxi companies seen through the theory of disruptive innovation helps explain the company’s rapid rise. It is disruptive relative to black car services and taxis. And ride sharing app’s powerful need to continue to climb up-market makes me think it is worth watching its larger ambitions of replacing car ownership as well. This disruptive story is not yet over. And it should serve as a cautionary tale for all who think regulations can prevent disruption from occurring.

2nd Webpage: How Ride-Sharing Became Disruptive

Who is affected in the disruption?
 
Traditional taxi- Cab Operators and drivers:
Essentially ride sharing is wiping out the taxi cab industry and particularly the operators and the drivers of the traditional taxi company. It forces them to either update and compete with the new trend. Unlike the regular taxis, ride sharing innovation is opening up a new market with its various forays, which the traditional cab company cannot cope up with.
At a certain level that regular taxis cannot offer service like, dabbling in chopper rides, food delivery and more. This innovation allows the ride sharing company to grow and break the stranglehold taxis had on consumers.

According to (limpin 2018), drivers chose to be in the ride sharing industry instead of a traditional one because of the financial benefits they enjoy from the service.

Another factor is that Uber tailors to supply and demand using surge pricing as an incentive to increase the amount of drivers during peak hours. Also in ride sharing, non-professional drivers of private vehicles can now provide safe, reliable, and affordable point-to-point rides and enable the riding public to efficiently get a ride with a tap on a smartphone.

In addition, the emergence of the ridesharing phenomenon has also created new labour opportunities and conditions of the driving work itself. Moreover, ridesharing promises to improve the livelihood of the drivers. Ride sharing companies specifically look to provide a safe transportation platform including screening all drivers and vehicles, education and code of conduct, including safety features, support services, and insurance. With these advantages surely the drivers will earn more and be protected from their trips as well.

It affected the consumer in a positive and negative way:
 
A positive impact is that ride-sharing made rides better in many ways due to the feedback mechanism in their app which continuously improved as new parameters have been and are added due to consumers' concern. In ride sharing if there are any issues, it can be directly resolved from the app and get a refund which is near impossible to do or extremely complicated when it comes to regular taxis. It also helped not only our consumers but also the society and the environment since it eliminates traffic congestion, conserving fuel and reducing air pollution as well, also it helped save the travel cost and time. (Furuhata et al. 2013).
 
Yet on a negative thought, we have to bear in mind that our elders are not fully immersed with the latest technology therefore there is a small glitch when it comes to usage of applications for them. However, the app has a 911 emergency call which is essential when you have elderly clients.  

 
Statistical data of:

Passengers who choose ride sharing over taxi
The Philippines is one of the wide adopters of ridesharing services with an estimated 2.96 million users in 2018 and is expected to hit 5.4 million by 2022 (Statista 2018a). Consequently, the Philippines became the first country to develop nationwide ride-hailing regulations, which allowed app-based transportation services to operate legally anywhere in the nation (Toppa 2015). The increasing demand for mobility and the lack of adequate mass transport, especially in Metro Manila, was what apparently impelled the legalization of ridesharing services (Morales 2015). Ride sharing companies like Grab stated that their app has been downloaded to 139 million devices, also that they receive more than 6 million ride orders daily. Customers are persuaded to go for ride sharing like Grab since they worked on customer retention by creating a reward program that allows clients to earn points that can be redeemed in various ways, like airline discounts, free fast-food, and free rides. They also extend their financial services, by releasing its QR-code based mobile payment app, GrabPay in 2016.
A Statista report (2018b) shows that a worldwide user penetration rate of ridesharing services is at 9.8% in 2018 and is expected to hit 13.3% in 2022..
 













In the United State, Uber currently has 75 million riders globally.In a survey in the US 25% of customers used ride sharing service once per month while Lyft another ride sharing company  has 32 million users in the US within the same period of study.
 
Drivers who choose transport companies instead of taxi companies
 
In ride sharing innovation Uber was one of the first companies that conquered the platform
It has been able to develop systems which exploit the full potential of the assets (cars), resulting in lower cost and high turnover, thereby resulting in benefits to the customers as well as the driver. The new ecosystem of ride sharing services created by Uber has been able to create a dent into the otherwise “hard to crack” taxi industry. Uber has universally
transformed the taxi industry. The company has managed to restore the confidence of consumers in ride sharing services. Uber changed the dynamics all together by making it possible to order cabs digitally. The proliferation of ridesharing services could be attributed to the economic benefits, in particular monetary gains, afforded to the drivers (Hamari et al. 2016; Hawlitschek et al. 2016; Malone and Dillahunt 2015; Tussyadiah 2015). For instance, about one-third of the Uber drivers in the United States engaged in the service to earn money while looking for more side incomes.
 
Uber has 3 million drivers globally. 800,000 drivers in the United states alone and it is operating in almost 60 countries and counting. As of third quarter in 2019 there were 3 million Lyft drivers. Grab company has had 2.8 million people worldwide that drive for them.

In the Philippines last June 2019 we have an estimate of  45,000 TNVS drivers currently registered under grab Philippines.

3rd Webpage: The Impact of Ride-Sharing Disruption

How the income of those in the Taxi Industry is affected

Because of this disruption which involved the shift of passengers and drivers to Ride-sharing companies, there is a significant decrease in the economy of the Taxi Industry, both operators and drivers alike. 

The figure below shows the comparative earnings of Uber Drivers and Taxi Drivers in the U.S. on an hourly basis. 
















In the Philippine setting, a study was conducted by Beltran et.al (2019), wherein the researchers recruited informants from the Philippines from varied major areas of Metro Manila. The informants were nine drivers of a conventional taxi who have been driving such for at least 5 years and some taxi operators and LTFRB personnel as well. After data collection, one of the six emergent themes that were developed from the data was the financial effects of the presence of Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) on the taxi drivers and operators wherein the informants expressed concerns on the economic consequence of TNVS sharing their market. According to one of the informants, “It (income) has significantly decreased. Before, the income in taxi driving was good. But, with their (TNVS) presence, you are fortunate to earn Php1000 for a 24 hours of taxi driving”. The researchers also cited a similar study conducted by Chang (2017) about The Economic Effects of Uber on Taxi Drivers in Taiwan. Journal of Competition Law and Economics wherein results showed that the regular revenue of taxi drivers is reduced by an estimated 12% in the first year of Uber operation and 18% in its third year. 

A survey was conducted by Yugatech wherein they interviewed the taxi drivers who participated in the survey. Driver “Ernesto” shared his sentiments regarding his declining profits as Uber and Grab become the more preferred service by the riding public. “Yung kinakaltas sa’min na boundary e tumataas na, pero nalulugi kami sa hina ng pasada namin sa kalsada. Tingin ko kikita ako ng malaki kung magddrive ako for Uber.” 

But why do ride-sharing drivers earn more than taxi drivers?

Besides the fact that there is an increase in the passengers that prefer to opt for ride-sharing services resulting in a larger market, a significant factor that increases the profit of ride-sharing drivers is the software that allows them to better optimize their time and services. According to Oxford Martin School’s Carl Benedikt Frey who studied the impact that Uber has had on the income of taxi drivers in a range of U.S. cities. “The higher hourly earnings among self-employed drivers suggest that capacity utilization, in terms of the time spent in the car with a passenger, has increased with Uber, as its platform allows for better matching between drivers and passengers. But for traditional taxi drivers, the effect has been the opposite, with a decline in the amount of time they have a passenger in their vehicle”.

Key Features of Ride-Sharing Apps

Key Features of Ride-Sharing Apps

Ride-sharing apps have been in demand lately. With the invention of the internet and the rise of mobile devices, ride-matching companies eventually migrated online. Through mobile applications that can be downloaded via the internet and can be used almost anywhere, ride-sharing companies such as Uber, Lyft, and GrabTaxi have disrupted the ride-hailing field. Below are some key features of ride-sharing applications: 

Accessibility
Anyone with an internet-enabled phone can download a ride-sharing app. For android users, one can get it through Google Play Store and the Apple Store for iOS users. People with disabilities so as the elderly could even access key services in the app which are tailored for their needs (e.g. UberASSIST).   

Convenience
Another key feature of ride-sharing apps is its convenience. Compared to regular taxis which mostly involves hailing a cab on the streets, ride-sharing apps allow people to book rides with just a few clicks. It even offers features such as advance price estimates and cashless in-app payment. Ride-sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft also offer services such as split fare, multiple destinations, scheduled rides, and a variety of vehicle options and promotions depending on the customer’s budget and needs. They even have cancellation features which could be accessed by both the driver and the passenger so as in-app driver tips and trip rating functions to assess customer experience. 

Safety 
Ride-sharing apps also offer features where one can share his or her location. Uber has a “Share Your Trip” function wherein one can send a trip data to 5 trusted contacts. Lyft, on the other hand, has a “Send ETA” feature where one could send a text message with an in-app link to one’s current route and location. Both of these apps would also send driver information, car details, and trip progress toward the destination. 

Affordability 
Ride-sharing apps themselves are usually free, however, the services they offer are the ones that users pay for. In the case of ride-sharing apps, Uber and Lyft in particular claim that they are about 50% cheaper than a taxi and owning a car, though depending on the services and the time of day, their prices may rise due to high demand or may fall during lower times. 

Additionally, the average cost per mile for ride-sharing apps is about $2, with base rates ranging between $1 and $2 per mile compared to taxis which have a base rate of $2.60 and a distance charge of $2.70 per mile. Moreover, according to Statista.com, a survey back in 2019 found that Uber, the cheapest ridesharing service, had an average cost of 25.37 U.S. dollars per ride while a taxi, on the other hand, had 36.17 U.S. dollars per ride. Considering this, ride-sharing apps are indeed cheaper than hailing a taxi. 

To further compare and contrast the key features of vehicles using ride-sharing apps and taxis, below is a table comparing the two:

Business Model of Ride-Sharing vs. Taxi

Business Model of Ride Sharing vs. Taxi

Taxis has been operating since 1980. Taxi services are everywhere in the city that is operated by a company or an independent owner. Regarding rideshare services, the vehicle driver is commonly the owner as he/she drives his vehicle to earn money by driving passengers to a certain place.  

Rideshare vehicles customarily have a company sticker or logo as an identifier. For example, we can spot the Uber logo on all the cars operating this service. On the other hand, a taxi will typically possess a ‘taxi’ sticker or sometimes a sticker of the company that owns it. 

Almost all ridesharing companies require their drivers to take pieces of training before they can start working with them in order to teach the various security precautions, rules, etiquettes, etc. For taxi services and drivers, ought to be licensed by the government authority like LTO (Land Transportation Office) in order for them to operate in a specific city or town.

Taxi and ridesharing services have middlemen. The app owner companies like Uber and other ridesharing services are the middlemen who charge a fee from the drivers’ profits in trade for their services. The taxi owner or company owner can be the middleman where they may charge a percentage from the drivers for letting them utilize the taxi unit/s.

Talking about the schedule, taxi drivers usually work fixed turns and do not hold so enough flexibility. On the other hand, Ride-share drivers, possess the flexibility to work, they are free to work anytime they want.

They have different ways how to get their service. Rideshare services operate by means of mobile applications, in which a rider can book a vehicle. The driver is notified that someone is needing their service through the app and he will arrive and pick up the passengers at the requested location. With this application, passengers can also trace the driver’s location while waiting.

In contrast, taxi services usually operate through phone calls and straight hailing, where usually a passenger has to wait on the road and make a sign to stop a taxi or call a taxi company asking to send a taxi to pick them up at the requested address.

Pricing is a big part of taking a taxi or rideshare services. Taxis charge per kilometer when moving and charge per minute while it is not in motion. In a different manner, rideshare services charge per kilometer and per minute, despite whether they are in motion or not and with some exclusions.

What Lies Ahead
 
Will the continuous disruption of ride sharing applications put an end to the taxi industry? 
Possibly. If so, former taxi drivers might switch to working for ridesharing companies. Although ridesharing applications disrupt the market, it also provides job opportunities to many. The contractors and independent taxi owners, however, will be at loss in this scenario. 
 
Nonetheless, the speeding momentum of ridesharing companies' market share growth, somehow developing a monopoly, is a call for governments and other legal subjects to appropriately regulate and ensure that its price policy is fair and not founded on tax schemes or predatory pricing.
 
In the further future, will the convenience of such use of new technologies opt the people to avail these kinds of transportation services over actually owning their own automobiles? If so, then ridesharing applications will not only disrupt the taxi industry but also automobile companies' market. However, it is highly likely that future transportation services that utilizes new technologies will be run by big tech companies and automakers. In his article "Why Uber and Lyft Will Have a Short Lifespan..", Peppers (2020) discusses how ridesharing services themselves will be subject to the same forces of innovation that has been overturning the taxi industry. This is a good point since automakers and tech giants are now looking for a quick way to monetize self-driving technology. 
 
Driverless cars represent both a threat and an opportunity for car makers. The threat, obviously, is that far fewer people will need to own their own cars. But the opportunity is that the auto companies themselves have the capital necessary to deploy fleets of self-driving cars for hiring out on an hourly basis. 
-Pepper, 2020
 
The future of ride sharing applications and its disruptive features is fast approaching. New technologies, in general, continue to change our everyday lives. Although we cannot completely prepare for these changes, asking ourselves where we're heading is always a good way to sort out our attitudes, plans, and policies.
